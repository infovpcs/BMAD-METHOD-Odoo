# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMAD workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

# Odoo Website Development Checklist

- [ ] **Module Setup:**
    - [ ] Custom module lists `website` as a dependency in `__manifest__.py`.
    - [ ] Assets (JS, CSS) are defined in `__manifest__.py` under `web.assets_frontend` or `web.assets_website` or custom bundles.
- [ ] **Page Creation:**
    - [ ] New static pages are defined as QWeb templates in XML files.
    - [ ] Pages are linked to menu items if required.
- [ ] **Template Extension:**
    - [ ] Existing Odoo website QWeb templates are extended using `t-extend` and precise `xpath` expressions.
    - [ ] Changes are non-intrusive and do not break core website functionality.
- [ ] **Snippet Development:**
    - [ ] Custom snippets are defined with clear QWeb templates (`<template id="..." name="...">`).
    - [ ] Snippets have intuitive UI options defined in `views/options.xml` if needed.
    - [ ] JavaScript for snippet interactivity is correctly implemented and loaded.
- [ ] **Controller Development/Extension:**
    - [ ] Python controllers use `@http.route` with `type='http'` and `website=True`.
    - [ ] `auth` is set appropriately (`public`, `user`, `none`).
    - [ ] Controllers render templates using `request.render()` and pass necessary data.
    - [ ] Form submissions are handled securely (e.g., CSRF protection where applicable).
- [ ] **Frontend Technologies:**
    - [ ] JavaScript is used modularly; avoid global variables.
    - [ ] CSS is well-organized (e.g., using SCSS, BEM methodology) and adheres to Odoo's theme structure.
    - [ ] Responsive design principles are applied for mobile-friendliness.
- [ ] **Data Interaction:**
    - [ ] Data fetched from Odoo backend in controllers is efficient.
    - [ ] User input from website forms is validated and securely stored.
- [ ] **SEO & Performance:**
    - [ ] Pages have appropriate meta tags and titles.
    - [ ] Images are optimized; lazy loading considered.
    - [ ] Overall page load times are acceptable.
- [ ] **Security:**
    - [ ] Forms are protected against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection).
    - [ ] Public-facing controllers carefully manage data exposure.
- [ ] **User Experience:**
    - [ ] Website navigation is clear and intuitive.
    - [ ] Custom features integrate seamlessly with existing Odoo website design.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] All custom pages and features are tested across different browsers and devices.
    - [ ] Form submissions and dynamic elements are thoroughly tested.
    - [ ] Ensure clearing browser cache resolves display issues during development.

# Odoo Point of Sale (PoS) Development Checklist

- [ ] **Module Setup:**
    - [ ] Custom module lists `point_of_sale` as a dependency.
    - [ ] PoS-specific assets (JS, XML) are declared in `__manifest__.py` under the `point_of_sale.assets` bundle.
- [ ] **JavaScript Architecture:**
    - [ ] Understands the PoS JavaScript architecture (models, screens, widgets).
    - [ ] Uses `patch` (for OWL-based PoS) or `Class.include` (for older versions) to extend existing components.
    - [ ] Avoids directly modifying core PoS files; always extend.
- [ ] **PoS Models Extension:**
    - [ ] New fields are added to `Order`, `Orderline`, `Product`, `Customer` models where needed.
    - [ ] `export_as_json` and `init_from_JSON` methods are overridden to handle custom fields correctly for data synchronization.
- [ ] **UI Customization:**
    - [ ] New buttons, screens, or widgets are correctly integrated into the PoS UI.
    - [ ] QWeb templates for PoS UI (`static/src/xml`) are properly extended/created.
    - [ ] Events are correctly handled (`t-on-click`, `onClick` methods).
- [ ] **Backend Communication (RPC):**
    - [ ] PoS makes efficient RPC calls to the Odoo backend when necessary (e.g., fetching custom data, saving custom fields).
    - [ ] Backend Python methods invoked by PoS are secure and performant.
- [ ] **Data Persistence:**
    - [ ] Ensures custom data created in PoS is correctly synchronized and persisted to the Odoo backend.
    - [ ] Handles offline mode considerations (data queuing, re-synchronization).
- [ ] **Error Handling:**
    - [ ] Robust error handling for network issues or backend RPC failures.
    - [ ] User-friendly error messages are displayed in PoS.
    - [ ] Critical errors are logged to the browser console.
- [ ] **Performance:**
    - [ ] PoS remains responsive, especially during busy periods.
    - [ ] Customizations do not introduce significant lag.
    - [ ] Large data sets are handled efficiently.
- [ ] **Usability:**
    - [ ] Customizations enhance the PoS user experience for cashiers.
    - [ ] UI elements are intuitive and consistent with PoS design.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Thoroughly tests custom PoS functionalities in various scenarios (online/offline, different products/customers).
    - [ ] Ensures clearing browser cache and restarting PoS session during development to pick up latest changes.
    - [ ] Manual testing covers end-to-end flows.
